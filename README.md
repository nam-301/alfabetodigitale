# Benvenuti! Welcome!

Benvenuti in pensierodigitale! :it: Per la versione italiana, cliccate [qui](#italiano).

:seedling: Thank you for visiting the **pensierodigitale** project. We are happy you are here :seedling:

**Pensierodigitale** is a made-up Italian word that can be roughly be translated as "digital thinking".

## Who are we?

We are an informal group of people—physically based in a small mountain town in northern Italy—who are passionate about everything digital and who think it is important that access to the digital world does not remain a privilege of a few people.

In our town, in recent years, we have seen the arrival of many migrants (mainly from West Africa and South Asia) who were escaping violence and poverty. Now they are trying to begin a new life in Italy, getting an education if they need to, and looking for jobs.

Most of the migrants come from deprived backgrounds and received little or no formal education. But it's hard to find a job with no education and no immediately spendable skills! Starting from this consideration, we decided to help them gain some basic digital skills (for example: how to use a word processor, how to do an effective search on the Internet, how to exhange files .. )

## What are we doing?

We are organizing digital skills courses for low-educated migrants who recently arrived in our community, in northern Italy.

Various editions of the course have been carried out since 2016, but this is the first time we, the teachers, try to **systematise and share** the materials we use.

We are now **collecting teaching materials** that we can re-use in our own course and that other teachers can use in theirs, wherever they are.

## What is non-formal education?

Non-formal education is (roughly) a way of teaching that does not require the teacher to stand in front of the class and give a lecture, but that rather involves the students in a lot of practical activities: act, move around, play games in teams, draw, tell stories .. In this way, not only it is much easier to overcome languge and cultural barriers, but the students learn much more and have fun doint it!

Our digital skills courses are based on this principles, because we observed that such non-formal methods are the most effective with our students (migrants who received little or no formal education).

## What is this place?

This place is a **repository** (it is a bit like a shared folder everyone can contribute to *and* download the materials from) that contains curricula, syllabi and especially **materials for practical classroom activities** of an ongoing digital literacy course for **low-educated migrants**.

It is intended for:

* sharing the effort of creating teaching materials

* helping other teachers who may reuse the materials that they will find here.

## What do we need?

:loudspeaker: We are looking for people who can help us create more teaching materials and improve the curriculm!

So if you are:

* a teacher with interest and/or expertise in non-formal education methods and/or in teaching to migrants;
* an expert in educational technology; 
* a developer/computer scientist/any kind of IT-related professional interested in having a real-world impact besides you daily job ..

... we'd love to see your contribution here!

You will find a list of the materials we currently need here. [add link]
